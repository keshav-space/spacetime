Overview
---------

| VulnTotal ``cross-validates`` the vulnerability coverage of publicly available vulnerability check tools and databases.
| It's inspired by the VirusTotal multi-scanner virus scanning service.
There are scenarios where a package is reported as vulnerable by some tools or databases but not by others, VulnTotal helps in detection such anomaly.
We can gradually work with these tool providers to keep each other apprised about newly discovered vulnerabilities and anomaly, making FOSS more secure.

.. note::
   A PURL is a URL string used to identify and locate a software package in a mostly universal and uniform 
   way across programming languages, package managers, packaging conventions, tools, APIs and databases.

VulnTotal Development - Walkthrough
-----------------

Initial Configuration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The initial PR and commits outlined the core structure and implemented ``VendorData`` and ``DataSource`` inside ``validator.py``.
| **VendorData** is dataclass that encapsulates ``aliases``, ``affected_versions`` and ``fixed_versions`` for a vulnerability.
| **DataSource** outlines core methords such as ``datasource_advisory`` and ``supported_ecosystem`` to be implemented by subclass.

Adding DataSource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| The initial config made adding datasource fairly smooth. AnyNewDataSource just needed to inherit ``DataSource`` and implement ``datasource_advisory`` and ``supported_ecosystem``
| **datasource_advisory** is core method that takes PURL as an arguments and yields ``VendorData``
| **supported_ecosystem** should return a dictionary that maps PURL equivalent of ecosystem (aka purl.type) to DataSource equivalent ecosystem.
| 

Currently Supports DataSource
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Open Source Vulnerability <osv.dev>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OSV provides API end point for querying package vulnerability. Unfortunately for NuGet, 
OSV doesn't do case normalization on package name. So the datasource employs NuGet SearchQueryService for 
discovering the valid case-sensitive package name and then uses that to query OSV.
For more on this issue see `nexB/vulnerablecode/#800 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/issues/800>`_

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#788 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/788>`_

Open Source Insights <deps.dev> 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Writing datasource for deps was quite uneventful. Deps doesn't provide any documented API except 
for GCP BigQuery, but it does have obfuscated API and DepsDataSource makes use of that.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#789 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/789>`_

GitHub Advisory Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

GitHub provide GraphQL end-point for querying package vulnerability, but it comes with a caveat 
that one can't query a specific version of a particular package. It dumps vulnerability related to 
all the versions of a particular package. For this vulntotal_utils implements a specialized method
``github_constraints_satisfied`` to filters out vulnerability for specific version.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#804 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/804>`_
   
Sonatype OSS Index
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

OSSIndexDataSource makes use of oss-index API. OSS-Index only provides CVE's related 
particular package version and makes no mention of either the affected package versions 
or fixed package version.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#829 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/829>`_

VulnerableCode Advisory Database
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

VulnerableCodeDataSource currently make use of local VulnerableCode instance, but soon 
will be migrated to global VulnerableCode instance.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#832 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/832>`_
   
Snyk Vulnerability Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Snyk comes with no API whatsoever, so had to restore to web scrapping using BeautifulSoup. 
Among all the datasources currently available, Snyk is the only one that keeps track of malicious packages.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#842 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/842>`_
   
GitLab Gemnasium Advisory Database
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Again, GitLab comes with no API, so GitLabDataSource directly fetches data from GitLab gemnasium 
repository. For case-sensitive package name, GitLab GraphQL end-point is used to pinpoint such packages.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#883 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/883>`_

Automatic Datasourse Registery 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| All new Datasource must be added to ``DATASOURCE_REGISTERY`` to make it available for use. 
| Fortunately ``__init__.py`` is configured to take care of this, as soon as a new and valid 
datasource file is added inside datasources directory it automatically gets registered and vice versa.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#901 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/901>`_

Command-line Interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VulnTotal CLI takes PURL as an argument and returns vulnerability data from various data sources. 
By default, vulnerability data is grouped by CVE.
It also supports JSON and YAML data dump. 
Since most datasources are Network I/O intensive, so by default CLI makes use of ThreadPoolExecutor 
for better efficiency.

* `nexB/vulnerablecode#801 <https://github.com/nexB/vulnerablecode/pull/801>`_

.. tip::
   | CLI comes with lots of hidden features that are specially useful while debugging a datasource.
   | Look inside ``vulntotal_cli.py`` to discover them all.

Pre GSoC
----------

* Test sorting of all the OpenSSL versions ever released.  `nexB/univers#61 <https://github.com/nexB/univers/pull/61>`_

Closing Thoughts
-------------------

Thoroughly enjoyed working on this project. Weekly calls were greatly helpful and thanks to 
`Philippe <https://github.com/pombredanne>`_, `Hritik <https://github.com/hritik14>`_, 
`Tushar <https://github.com/TG1999>`_ and `Shivam <https://github.com/sbs2001>`_ for the 
thoughtful inputs. Learned a lot about various interesting projects and what it takes to tame some of 
the real world problems. Greatly enhanced my ability to conduct myself in an open source world. All in all, it's 
been a remarkable journey.
